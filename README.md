# Personal Blog Website

A multi-page website built using `HTML` and `CSS` skills which includes custom images, layout, and styling. Along with the webpage design considerations, I worked to appropriately structure the files, as well as use proper formatting & style. The project also focusses on using Flexbox and Grid systems to make the page responsive.

## Development

* Create `index.html` as the landing page with the following:
  * Navbar with links to other pages
  * Cover image 
  * Basic page content
  * Footer with social media links
  
* Create `views` directory with the following pages:
  * `AboutUsComponent.html` with about-us info
  * `BlogsComponent.html` with all blog posts
  * `BlogPostComponent.html` about one of the post
  
  Reuse navbar and footer code

* Create `css` directory with the following files:
  * `styles.css` with the global styling
  
  Page Specific CSS
  * `aboutus.css`
  * `blogpost.css`
  * `blogs.css`
  
  Component specific CSS
  * `footer.css`
  * `navbar.css`

  Import all the modularized css files to `css/styles.css`

* Create `js` directory with the following file:
  * `app.js` for adding navbar toggle button functionality
